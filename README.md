# **Secura.AI – Secure Financial Transactions & Advisory System**

Secura.AI is a conceptual financial security and advisory platform designed to address critical challenges in modern digital transactions, including transaction fraud, incorrect fund transfers, and lack of transparent consumer-side protection. The project explores how AI-driven advisory systems and advanced encryption mechanisms can be combined to improve trust, security, and user confidence in digital banking ecosystems.

At its core, Secura.AI proposes an AI-powered financial advisor chatbot that assists users in understanding transactions, identifying potential risks, and making informed financial decisions. The advisor is designed to act as an intelligent interface between consumers and financial systems, offering contextual guidance, alerts, and explanations in real time.

A key innovation of Secura.AI lies in its proposed transaction security architecture. The system introduces a concept where transaction details are encrypted in a way that ensures only the consumer and the bank can access sensitive information. In cases where funds are mistakenly transferred to an incorrect recipient, the framework proposes an automated, secure reversal mechanism that allows the transaction to be rolled back directly to the sender’s account without additional charges or manual intervention. This approach draws inspiration from blockchain-style verification while focusing on enhanced privacy, controlled access, and reduced operational friction.

Although the project was not fully implemented due to financial and infrastructural constraints, Secura.AI emphasizes system design, feasibility analysis, and security-first thinking. The focus remained on defining robust workflows, identifying real-world banking pain points, and proposing technically viable solutions aligned with existing financial regulations and infrastructure.

Secura.AI was presented at Eureka 2024, where it underwent early-stage evaluation. While the project did not progress further in selection rounds, it served as a strong exercise in problem-solving, system architecture design, and applied AI thinking within the fintech domain.

This repository documents the concept, system architecture, workflows, and future scope of Secura.AI, including potential extensions such as blockchain integration, multi-bank interoperability, and regulatory compliance layers.
